                            The moniker of artist and data scientist <span style='color:lightblue;top:0;'>Xristos K</span>. Combining their creative and technical skills, Xristos creates audio and visual art. 
                            At a young age, they played guitar and made various forms of visual art, then went onto study Philosophy and Science. After undergrad, Xristos graduated 
                            from a data science bootcamp, where they learned the skills of a data analyst, scientist, and engineer.
                            <p></p>
                            They have written a series of data stories as a data journalist and researcher at <a class='bio-link' href='https://qri.io/'>Qri</a>.
                            As data and machine learning become more complex, and integrated with art, Xristos works as c.thru.shell, a project that utilizes their collective 
                            experiences and skills. This project isn't centered around any consistent style, it is an individual reflection of life in the 21st century with 
                            executive dysfunction.
                            <p></p>
